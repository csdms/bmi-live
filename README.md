# BMI Live

Code, slides, and Jupyter Notebook examples
for the **BMI Live** clinic held at the
[2019 CSDMS Annual Meeting](https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/CSDMS_meeting_2019),
May 21-23, in Boulder, Colorado.

## The Goal

Given a model, wrap it in a
[Basic Model Interface (BMI)](http://bmi.readthedocs.io)
in realtime.

## The Plan

1. Start with a model
1. View the list of BMI methods and their signatures
   at http://bmi.readthedocs.io
1. Together, implement the BMI methods for the model!
1. Evaluate our results in a Jupyter Notebook (and make a plot,
   maybe using widgets!)

## The Requirements

* Laptop
* Text editor
* Python distribution (we recommend the
  [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) Python 3
  distribution)
* Optionally, a [GitHub](https://github.com) account, and `git` or
  GitHub Desktop
