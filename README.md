# BMI Live

Code for the **BMI Live** clinic
held at the
[2018 CSDMS Annual Meeting](https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/Form:Annualmeeting2018),
May 22-24, in Boulder, Colorado.

## The Goal

Given a model, wrap it in a BMI in realtime.
We also hope show some best practices in Python development.

## The Plan

1. Start with a model
1. View the list of BMI methods and their signatures
   at http://bmi-python.readthedocs.io
1. Together, implement the BMI methods for our model!
1. Test the results in a Jupyter Notebook (and make a plot,
   maybe using widgets!)

## The Requirements

* Laptop
* Text editor
* Python distribution (we recommend the
  [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) Python 2.7
  distribution)
* Optionally, a [GitHub](https://github.com) account, and `git` or
  GitHub Desktop
